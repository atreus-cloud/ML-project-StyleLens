# ML-project-StyleLens

## Overview

StyleLens is a deep learning-based system that classifies fashion images into different clothing styles and recommends visually similar outfits. The model can be used initially for personal wardrobe organization, and extended to e-commerce as the next step.


# Approach & Model Architecture

This project consists of two main tasks:

1) Style Classification – Predict the clothing style of an image (e.g., casual, formal, streetwear).
2) Recommendation System – Suggest similar styles using feature embeddings.

# Deployment & Real-World Application
1) Web App / Mobile App

    Building backend for image uploads.
    Using a Streamlit or React-based frontend to allow users to upload photos.
    Displaying predicted clothing style + top-5 recommended outfits.

2) E-Commerce Integration

    Using fashion brand APIs to recommend buyable items.
    Implementing a chatbot for fashion advice based on user preferences.

3) Edge Deployment

    Converting the model to TensorFlow Lite for mobile deployment.
